## The problem

I didn't really know how to solve the checkQuestion together with the filterQuestions function. I at first compared filterQuestion true or false inside nested if/else statements, which worked fine - but made the code longer than neccessary. We where discussing the code in our team, which is where the thought of using the keep variable arised. By declaring keep within checkQuestion, that variable could instead be used to make the comparison. If the secret and value match that value is going to be assigned to "keep", so when the choice is "true" that alert will run from filterCharacters. I saved the function I made first inside the code aswell. 

Wanted to add the characters via an api, when I decided to try doing the stretch goals. I felt it would take more time to create my own new characters, than using an api and learning how to do that. I watched a video on FrontEnd Masters about it (Javascript First Steps with Anjana Vakil)
